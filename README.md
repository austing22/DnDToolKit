# D&D Toolkit

**D&D Toolkit** is a mobile-first, full-stack web application designed to help Dungeon Masters (DMs) and players stay organized and immersed in their Dungeons & Dragons campaigns. The app provides tools for character tracking, adventure logging, NPC and encounter generation, and combat management — all in one clean and accessible interface.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This repository contains the **entire codebase and project documentation** for the DM Toolkit. The goal of this project is to provide a high-utility, low-friction application that improves quality of life for tabletop RPG players, without the complexity or cost of many existing tools.

By consolidating both the **user interface** and the **service layer logic** in a single codebase, the project supports a feature-focused development process and deployment pipeline.
